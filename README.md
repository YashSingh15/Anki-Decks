# Anki-Decks
Collection of Anki Decks I made for programming

Anki is a Spaced Repetition Flashcard platform that allows you to memorize pieces of information by reviewing 'cards' with increasing intervals. 
Spaced Repetition works on the idea of the forgetting curve, so you are exposed to pieces of information right before you're about to forget them.
This helps build stronger memories each time you review information.

NOTE: These cards use a special card type which comes with the deck, but requires an additional addon to work. This makes it so that you're able to type
out your answers rather than just 'recall' them when reviewing a card. This helps build pratice with writing actual code

The card type 'Programming' should be included with the decks, so you don't have to worry about that. In case it isn't, I'll include the front and back
templates in a separte folder in the original directory.

These decks are original, and by no means complete. I'll update them here as I add more cards.
