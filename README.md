# Anki-Decks
Collection of Anki Decks I made for programming

Anki is a Spaced Repetition Flashcard platform that allows you to memorize pieces of information by reviewing 'cards' with increasing intervals. 
Spaced Repetition works on the idea of the forgetting curve, so you are exposed to pieces of information right before you're about to forget them.
This helps build stronger memories each time you review information.
